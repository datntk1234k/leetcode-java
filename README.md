# 🚀 LeetCode Roadmap – Java Solutions

This repository contains my **LeetCode solutions in Java**, structured as a personal learning roadmap.  
For each problem, I explore **multiple solutions** (from brute force to optimal) until I achieve the most efficient approach.  

My goal is to demonstrate:
- Strong problem-solving skills.  
- Clear understanding of **time & space complexity**.  
- Ability to **optimize solutions** and explain trade-offs.  
- Clean, maintainable code that follows Java conventions.

## 📌 Roadmap Overview

I follow a topic-based roadmap to systematically improve my Data Structures & Algorithms knowledge:

## 📈 Big-O Complexity Guide

I carefully analyze each solution’s complexity to ensure optimization:

- 🟢 **Good:** O(1), O(log n)  
- 🟠 **OK:** O(n), O(n log n)  
- 🔴 **Bad:** O(n²), O(2ⁿ), O(n!)

## 🗓 Commitment

To maintain consistency and growth, I commit to:
- Solving **at least 3 LeetCode problems per week**.  
- Exploring **multiple approaches** for each problem.  
- Identifying and documenting the **most optimal solution** in terms of time and space complexity.

## ✨ Why This Repo?

- ✅ Shows my **learning process** – from brute force → optimal.  
- ✅ Organized by **topics** (Arrays, Strings, HashMap, DP, Graphs, etc).  
- ✅ Easy to navigate for **recruiters & teammates**.  
- ✅ Demonstrates my ability to write **clean, well-documented code**.

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Add **unit tests** for each problem.  
- Document **time & space complexity** in each solution file.  
- Explore advanced topics (Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Tries).
